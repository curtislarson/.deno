These are basic modules that I find myself needing in most projects. Not really intended to be consumed by others but knock yourself out.

If something becomes mature enough that warrants more attention then you'll see it move under the [QuackWare](https://github.com/quackware) organization. But for the time being there is no guarantee of maintenance or responding to questions.
