# @quackware/deno-logger

Nothing special WIP logger that needs to stay consistent between multiple projects. This is a mix of code from the [Deno std log library](https://github.com/denoland/deno_std/tree/main/log) and custom stuff I've implemented.

Todo

- File handler
- Http handler
- There's always room for more colors
